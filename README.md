# What's for dinner?

Don't know what to eat today? just tell ***What's for dinner?*** what ingredients you have in your kitchen and we will suggest easy to follow recipes that you can make for yourself. Vegetarian?, lactose intolerant? No problem, our recipes have badges identifying dietary restrictions, soon you'll be able to filter by them too!.

***What's for dinner?*** was developed using JavaScript as part of the [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) developer bootcamp (WebDev-FT-092029) using the [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/) API.
